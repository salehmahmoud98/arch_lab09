## Load half and load byte

### introduction:

a "Load half" and "Load byte" implementation using MIPS micro-architecture was built upon Harris design in their book (reference)

`lh $storeReg imm($regRefearingToMemAddress)`

`lb $storeReg imm($regRefearingToMemAddress)`

the following is a machine code description for lh and lb

```
 lh: 100001 $regRefearingToMemAddress $storeReg iiiiiiii iiiiiiii
 lb: 100000 $regRefearingToMemAddress $storeReg iiiiiiii iiiiiiii
```

### Recipe:

#### Items/Pins:

1. pin_b (byte) :  used as a selector for mux[2]
2. half (half-word) : used as a selector for mux[1]
3. mux[1] (multiplexer): a multiplexer provide an option to full word or half word
4. mux[2] (multiplexer): a multiplixer provide an option to mux[1] or one byte

#### implementation:

this design is based on the fact that `lw` was already implemented and working well so why not to reuse it? at the output of  **MemToReg** multiplexer (`lw`'s output) i've used two multiplexers mux[1] and mux [2]

mux[1] will chose from the full word (32-bit) and a sign-extended half word `{16{halfword[15]},halfword[15:0]}` using **half pin** as a controller

| option (half pin) | operation                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0                 | output of mux[1] equals the full word    |
| 1                 | output of mux[1] equals half of the word |

mux[2] will chose from mux[1] output and a sign-extended one byte `{24{8-bits[7]},8-bits[7:0]}` using **half pin** as a controller

| option (b pin) | operation                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 0              | output of mux[2] equals mux[1]                 |
| 1              | output of mux[2] equals sign extended one byte |
